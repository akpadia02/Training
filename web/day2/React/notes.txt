-tree like structure created is DOM
-in memory represtation of html elements as object in tree
-easy to manipulate objects
-doc.getElementbyid is faster or doc.queryselector?
-react said dont manipulate dom yourself
-dom manipulation is costly operation that browser does
-react is lib(prove) (react.js)
-creating apps using vite




//ReactBasic.html
-react elements
-developer will never talk to dom (work with react elements)
