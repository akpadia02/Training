NodeJs
-Run JavaScript Everywhere
Node.jsÂ® is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.
-internally use JS event loop
-all req are piped(queued) and when server free its dequeued in JS but in node 
-two option to write code (synchronous and aychronous)
-blocking is something that takes time (ie aychronous api)
-thats why node is able to handle lot load and its fast
-node is js runtime atlowest level and use to create fast servers
-uses v8 engine ie just in broweser (fastest)
-u have nodejs apis using c++ internally
-js dont have access to kernal os etc (server needs to store info and its needed os ie js cant where node js comes in picture)
-libUV takes care about all this (its library)
-use to create server side web application which is faster
