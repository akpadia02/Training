client requested server. what does server does that?
-generating response means: sends content of physical file and that is server should have access to read content of file
-after reading content server needed to stream back file as response
-for that we use fs modules (have methods to read content of files)


client->server->index.html->client.js
content sends of index.htmkl to client and its notice client.js is called then again sends requests to server for client.js and gets reponse


-creating api
-json,html,css,js etc
if (req.url == "/") {
    fs.readFile("../client/Index.html", (err, data) => {
      if (!err) {
        res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
        res.end(data);
      } else {
        res.writeHead(500, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
        res.end("Something went wrong !");
      }
    });
  }
